## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
‚úÖ Manual deployment process caught issues early
‚úÖ Storage layout planning prevented upgrade bugs
‚úÖ Optimizer settings worked correctly for large contracts
‚úÖ UUPS pattern provides safe upgradeability
‚úÖ Modular architecture allows incremental deployment
‚úÖ Documentation-first approach saved debugging time

### Challenges Overcome
üîß AndeGovernor exceeded 24 KB limit ‚Üí Solved with optimizer_runs=1 and removing v1 SecurityExtensions (to add in v2)
üîß Proxy deployment initially failed ‚Üí Solved by correct calldata encoding
üîß Storage layout compatibility ‚Üí Solved by careful planning and gap slots
üîß TypeScript errors with duplicate chainIds ‚Üí Solved with temporary placeholder
üîß Celestia DA 401 errors ‚Üí Expected in dev, not blocking

### Key Takeaways for Future
üìö Always test proxy upgrades on fork before mainnet
üìö Manual deployment > scripts for production (scripts come after validation)
üìö Contract size optimization is crucial for feature-rich contracts
üìö Storage gaps are essential for safe upgrades
üìö Document everything as you go, not after
